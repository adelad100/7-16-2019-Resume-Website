					<p> My name is Adeoluwa John Ijidakinro, and while I initially struggled to think about 
					the first thing I want readers of my website to think about when they think of me, I settled
					on the word <strong>advocate</strong>. I am an advocate for underrepresented groups within the
					STEM field, whether it's by ethnicity, gender,  or socioeconomic status and I firmly believe 
					an essential part of any field is creating a pathway for that less fortunate to cross through. 
					Being a first generation son of Nigerian immigrant parents, I realize day, by day the value of 
					the pathways my parents carved for me to live within America, and over time its become my personal
					mantra. I aim to carry the torch my parents have passed to me and to create that same pathway to 
					opportunity and education for all underprivileged individuals that follow my footsteps. </p>
